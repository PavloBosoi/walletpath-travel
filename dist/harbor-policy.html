                            <p>Scott’s Cheap Flights, LLC, and its employees, agents, and affiliates (collectively “Scott’s Cheap Flights”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) shall make reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of those customers, employees, and other persons who entrust us with their personal information. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy sets forth how Scott’s Cheap Flights handles “Personal Data”, “Sensitive Personal Data” and “EU Employee Data” (as such terms are defined below, and collectively, the “Data”) that is collected in and transferred from countries in the European Union (“EU”) to Scott’s Cheap Flights in the United States. Such Data is transferred to the United States for purposes of handling customer service, subscription order and account management activities, managing our workforce, marketing our services, and otherwise maintaining our customer relationships and advancing our business. In furtherance of those activities and such Data transfers, Scott’s Cheap Flights adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy principles and the corresponding fifteen (15) Frequently Asked Questions developed by the United States Department of Commerce in coordination with the European Commission (the “Safe Harbor Principles”).</p>
                            <h2>Definitions</h2>
                            <p>The following terms are used throughout this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy and are defined here for ease of reference:</p>
                            <p>“Agent”: Means a third party that processes or otherwise uses Personal Data on behalf of and under the instructions of Scott’s Cheap Flights.</p>
                            <p>“EU Employee Data”: Means personally identifiable human resource data about individuals who are employed or otherwise engaged by Scott’s Cheap Flights or our affiliates, subsidiaries or business partners in the EU.</p>
                            <p>“Personal Data”: Means any information that identifies an individual, whether collected online or offline and regardless of format. Personal Data does not include information that is aggregated, pseudonymized, encoded or rendered anonymous, or publicly available personal information that has not been combined with non-public personal information, or information that pertains to a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified.</p>
                            <p>“Sensitive Personal Data”: Means personal information that is not EU Employee Data and that reveals the individual’s race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, criminal record or that concerns the individual’s own health or sex life.</p>
                            <p>This Policy incorporates by reference Scott’s Cheap Flights’ Terms of Use and uses the defined terms as defined in those Terms.</p>
                            <h2>Safe Harbor Principles</h2>
                            <p>Scott’s Cheap Flights has adopted the seven Safe Harbor Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity and enforcement with respect to Data that is collected in and transferred from countries in the EU to Scott’s Cheap Flights in the United States.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Notice. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy informs individuals about the purposes for which we collect and use Data, how to contact us, the parties to which that information may be accessible, and the choices and means, if any, that Scott’s Cheap Flights offers individuals for limiting the disclosure of such Data to non-Agent third parties.</li>
                                <li>Choice. Before Scott’s Cheap Flights uses Personal Data or EU Employee Data for a purpose that is incompatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data or EU Employee Data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or transfers Personal Data or EU Employee Data to a non-Agent third party for the purpose of allowing the non-Agent third party to exercise independent control over the Personal Data or EU Employee Data, the affected individuals will be given an opportunity to decline (opt out) having their Personal Data or EU Employee Data so used or transferred. The same choice principle shall apply to Sensitive Personal Data, but in the event that the Data is Sensitive Personal Data, the affected individual’s explicit consent (opt in) will be obtained prior to such use or transfer.</li>
                                <li>Onward Transfer. Scott’s Cheap Flights may transfer Data to its Agents once it obtains assurances that the relevant Agents will adequately safeguard the Data that is transferred to them. Such assurances may take the form of a contract obligating the Agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, Safe Harbor certification by the Agent, or the Agent being subject to an EU data protection directive or adequacy finding. If Scott’s Cheap Flights learns that an Agent is using or sharing Data in a way that is contrary to the assurances obtained, we will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such activity. Scott’s Cheap Flights may transfer Personal Data to a non-Agent third party where such transfer is consistent with the notice and choice principles detailed above or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.</li>
                                <li>Access. For those individuals who duly request it, Scott’s Cheap Flights will provide such individuals with reasonable access to Data that it holds about them, except in those circumstances that are set forth in the Safe Harbor Principles, such as when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or when the rights of persons other than the Data subject’s would be violated and except in those instances where the access being requested relates to Employee Data and the person making the request is not otherwise entitled to such access under the local labor or employment laws governing such person’s employment. For those individuals who receive access, Scott’s Cheap Flights will take reasonable steps to permit such individuals to correct, amend or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.</li>
                                <li>Security. Scott’s Cheap Flights will take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical precautions to protect Data in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</li>
                                <li>Data Integrity. Scott’s Cheap Flights will take reasonable steps to ensure that Data that is stored on its servers is used, processed, and maintained in a condition that is compatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized, subject to any deficiencies in the condition of the Data that existed at the time Scott’s Cheap Flights received such Data.</li>
                                <li>Enforcement. With respect to Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data, Scott’s Cheap Flights will assure compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles by investigating and attempting to resolve complaints regarding violations of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy directly with the complainant, and in the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by Scott’s Cheap Flights internally, the complainant may submit the matter to binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator pursuant to the Rules and Procedures established by the JAMS.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>The arbitration shall be held in the major United States city that is closest to your place of residence. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by Scott’s Cheap Flights’ Terms of Use (<a href="https://scottscheapflights.com/terms-and-conditions">https://scottscheapflights.com/terms-and-conditions</a>) and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with Scott’s Cheap Flights.</p>
                            <p>There shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you, Scott’s Cheap Flights. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, the provision above prohibiting the arbitration of on a class or representative basis is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Scott’s Cheap Flights shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</p>
                            <p>With respect to EU Employee Data, Scott’s Cheap Flights will assure compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles by investigating and attempting to resolve complaints regarding violations of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy directly with the complainant, and in the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by Scott’s Cheap Flights internally, the complainant may submit the matter to the dispute resolution program provided by the European Data Protection Authorities (“DPA’s”) panel. Scott’s Cheap Flights will then undertake to comply with any advice that may be given by the DPA’s in the matter.</p>
