If you believe you should be entitled to a refund after the first 30 days of your paid subscription, Scott’s Cheap Flights will issue refunds at its sole discretion. Scott’s Cheap Flights is under no obligation to issue a refund at any time, but please contact us if you want to discuss your issue.</p>

                            <h2>Arbitration</h2>
                            <p>By using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Scott’s Cheap Flights arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination of the scope or applicability of these Terms to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in the major United States city that is closest to our place of residence; (4) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with Scott’s Cheap Flights; (5) the arbitrator shall apply Oregon law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; and (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or Scott’s Cheap Flights. If any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Scott’s Cheap Flights shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.</p>
                            <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                            <p>The failure of Scott’s Cheap Flights to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. A waiver is valid and effective only if it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Scott’s Cheap Flights.
                                If any provision in the Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of other provisions.
                                The heading references herein are for convenience only. The headings do not constitute a part of the Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</p>
                            <p>You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Services must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
                            <p>The Terms, and your relationship with Scott’s Cheap Flights under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Oregon. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Terms that is not subject to the arbitration provision herein will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Multnomah County, Oregon, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.</p>
                            <h2>Location</h2>
